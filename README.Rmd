`VOSONDash` is an interactive [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) web application for the visualisation and analysis
of social network data. The app has a dashboard layout with sections for visualising and manipulating network graphs,
performing text analysis, displaying network metrics and the collection of network data using the
[vosonSML](https://github.com/vosonlab/vosonSML) R package.

## Installation

Install the latest release via CRAN:
``` r
install.packages("`r pkg`")
```

```{r release, include=FALSE}
rel_path <- NULL
if (all(sapply(c("httr", "dplyr", "jsonlite"), require, character.only = TRUE))) {
  rel_resp <- GET(paste0("https://api.github.com/repos/vosonlab/", pkg, "/releases"),
                  add_headers(Accept = "application/vnd.github.v3+json"))
  if (rel_resp$status_code == 200) {
    resp_content <- fromJSON(rawToChar(rel_resp$content))
    if ("tag_name" %in% names(resp_content)) {
      meta <- select(slice_head(resp_content), tag_name, tarball_url)
      rel_path <- pull(meta, tarball_url, tag_name)
      rel_inst <- paste0("Install the latest release via GitHub:\n\n",
                         "``` r\n",
                         "install.packages(\"", rel_path, "\",\n",
                         "                 repo = NULL, type = \"source\")\n",
                         "```\n")
    }
  }
}
```
`r if(!is.null(rel_path)) rel_inst`

Install the development version:
``` r
# library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("vosonlab/`r pkg`")
```

Once the VOSON Dashboard package is installed and loaded the Shiny web application can be run from the RStudio console
using the `runVOSONDash()` function.

```R
library(VOSONDash)
runVOSONDash()
```

### Running the app for the first time

When run the `VOSONDash` app will check that all of the R packages that are required to make it work are installed. It
is likely that some packages will be missing and the app will print a message indicating the missing packages and a
command that can be used to install them.

For example:

```r
runVOSONDash()
# =================================================
# VOSONDash v`r packageVersion(pkg)`
# ...
# Checking packages...
# 
# Error: Required packages missing.
# - shinyjs
# - visNetwork
# 
# Please install required packages before using VOSONDash:
# install.packages(c("shinyjs", "visNetwork"))
```

The missing packages can be installed using the above `install.packages` command.

After installing required packages and running again the `VOSONDash` Shiny app will open up in the default web browser.

## VOSON Dashboard

`VOSONDash` features an intuitive web interface with a section for 'Analysis' of graph data loaded from
[igraph](https://igraph.org/r/) objects and a section for the 'Collection' of social media data using
[vosonSML](https://github.com/vosonlab/vosonSML).

### Analysis

Network and text analysis of graph data.

* Network Graphs: Visualise and modify networks
* Network Metrics: Calculate node and network level metrics
* Text Analysis: Word frequency, word clouds and sentiment
* Assortativity: Calculate homogeneity and homophily indexes (if VOSON categorical node attributes present)

package.

### Collection and Network Creation

Graphical interfaces for collecting network data from social media API's.

* Collect: Twitter, youtube and reddit network data
* Create: different types of networks from the data such as activity, actor, twomode and semantic networks

### API Keys and Tokens

* API Keys: Enter, save, load API keys and create access tokens
