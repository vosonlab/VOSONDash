\title{Filter out graph vertices and edges from graph object that are isolates, multi edge or edge loops}
\usage{
applyGraphFilters(g, isolates = TRUE, multi_edge = TRUE,
  loops_edge = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{\pkg{igraph} \code{graph} object.}

\item{isolates}{Logical. Include isolate vertices in graph. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{multi_edge}{Logical. Include multiple edges between vertices in graph. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{loops_edge}{Logical. Include vertex edge loops in graph. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
An igraph graph object.
}
\description{
This function removes isolate vertices, multiple edges between vertices and or vertex edge loops from a 
graph.
}
\note{
Removing multiple edges or edge loops from a graph will simplify it and remove other edge attributes.
